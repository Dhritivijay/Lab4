#  Data Science Lab 5 – Probability Distributions & Titanic Visualizations

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks from my **Data Science Laboratory (Lab 5)**.  
They focus on understanding **probability distributions** through simulations and exploring the **Titanic dataset** using data visualization techniques.
